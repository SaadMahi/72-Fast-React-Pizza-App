## Loader Functionality:

**Step 1: Creating the Loader Function**

- A loader function is introduced to fetch data from an API. The convention is to name this function "loader."
- The data-fetching logic is abstracted into this function to maintain a centralized approach. In this case, the `getMenu` function from the `apiRestaurant.js` file is used to retrieve data.

**Step 2: Providing the Loader**

- The loader function is connected to a specific route, which, in this case, is the 'Menu' route. This is achieved by adding a `loader` property to the route configuration.

```javascript
    {
      path: '/menu',
      element: <Menu />,
      loader: menuLoader,
    }
```

**Step 3: Getting Data into the Component**

- The data fetched by the loader function needs to be accessed within the component. This is done using a custom hook called `useLoaderData()`. The data is automatically associated with the page and comes from the `menuLoader` specified in the route.
- The fetched data is logged to the console for verification.

**Step 4: Component Implementation**

- The `Menu` component is where the fetched data is used.
- The component's primary role is to render the menu data, and it uses the data fetched by the loader function.
- As soon as the 'Menu' route is accessed, a fetch request is automatically initiated, and the menu data is displayed in the component.

**Step 5: Benefits of Render-As-You-Fetch Strategy**

- The code follows a modern approach where data fetching is initiated at the same time as the route rendering. This is in contrast to the traditional approach of fetching data after the component has rendered, avoiding a "data loading waterfall."
- The `react-router` library is not only responsible for matching components to URLs but also for providing the necessary data for each page, making it more efficient and responsive.

In summary, this code exemplifies the use of a loader function to fetch data for a specific route, connecting it to the corresponding component, and rendering data in real-time as it's fetched. This "render-as-you-fetch" approach enhances the efficiency and user experience of the application.
