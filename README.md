# UpdateOrder Component

This code defines a React component named `UpdateOrder`, which is responsible for updating order data without navigation. The primary functionality is to mark an order as a priority order by using the provided `Button` component and a form from the `useFetcher` hook.

## Breakdown of the Code:

### Header Comments and Imports:

- The code begins with comments disabling ESLint rules for React prop types and unused variables.
- It imports necessary dependencies, including the `useFetcher` hook, the `Button` component, and the `updateOrder` function from the `apiRestaurant` service.

### Function Description:

- The main purpose of this component is to update order data without triggering navigation.
- A priority order is set if it wasn't selected before placing the order.
- The code references specific figures (e.g., `fig: 1`) to guide through the implementation steps.

### Form Implementation:

- The `UpdateOrder` component renders a form using the `fetcher.Form` component.
- The form has a method set to "PATCH" as it's intended for updating existing data.
- The form includes a `Button` with the label "Make Priority."

### Action Function:

- An asynchronous function named `action` is exported. This function is called when the form is submitted.
- The function receives an object with `request` and `params` properties. In this case, only `params` is used.
- The `updateOrder` function is called with the order ID and data containing the `priority` field set to `true`.
- The `await` keyword is used to ensure that the `updateOrder` function completes before proceeding.
- The function returns `null`.

### Component Usage:

- The `UpdateOrder` component is exported and receives an `order` prop, though it's not used in the current implementation.

### Usage of `useFetcher`:

- The `useFetcher` hook is used to obtain the `fetcher` object, which provides a form component for making non-navigational updates.

### Conclusion:

- The comments provide a step-by-step explanation of the implementation, emphasizing the use of the `fetcher.Form` for non-navigational data updates.
- Revalidation is highlighted as a powerful feature that triggers automatic data refetching and page rerendering when data changes.
