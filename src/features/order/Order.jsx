  /** FETCHING DATA WITHOUT NAVIGATION
   * So sometimes we need to fetch data from another routes,
   * data that is not associated with the current page or any page we want it on
   * but we want to do that without causing the navigation sometimes.
   *
   * For example lets say here in the order page, we need to fetch
   * data of menu fetch which we did before, So we have already written all the
   * logic of fetching data but it is associated to another route (Menu route).
   *
   * So we want to fetch that data on order page using something and as we already
   * wrote that logic there's no point writing that logic again. So in other
   * words we want to use the data from menu route but without the user going there and
   * for that we will be using
   * * useFetcher() // hook
   *
   * now what we want to do is that from that data which we will fetch
   * we need to get ingredients from there and use it here:
   * ! fig: 1
   *
   * So we can get that data from the menu route.
   * i) So as soon as this Order component mounts, we want to fetch that
   * menu data using our fetcher
   * ii) and to do this on component mount, we will have to use the useEffect hook
   * iii) so the way we use this fetcher is simply by calling
   * * fetcher.load('./menu'); //with name of the route
   * So this will load the data and store it in the fetcher object and then later
   * we can retrieve the data from there when we want
   * iv) and also remember to provide condition, fetch this data only when
   * data is not there, so remember same like navigation we did before
   * this fetcher also has 3 states: idle, loading and submitting. So by default
   * its state is idle. So only start fetching it's data when ever the fetcher is
   * in idle state
   * * if (!fetcher.data && fetcher.state === 'idle') fetcher.load('/menu');
   * v) and also include the fetcher in the dependencies array.
   * vi) now our data has started fetching let's check in network tab
   * ! fig: 2
   * Also let's log our fetched data
   * ! fig: 3
   * Now we want to pass ingredients data from here to these each orders
   * ! fig: 4
   * Let's also add the loading state
   * ! fig: 5
   *
   * vii) now as we have passed in the props let's use these two in that
   * component
   * ! fig: 6
   * done...
   *
   * 2) but a problem occurs when we search for the order id
   * ! fig: 7
   *
   * i) so the solution to this is that if this highlighted part doesn't exists
   * let's return an empty array, so this will fix the problem
   * ! fig: 8
   * That's because this join trying to join undefined
   * ! fig: 9
